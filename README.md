# Matplotlib_startup

Project (Learning Matplotlib)
Start - May

I accidentally deleted the repository where I officially started the journey of learning matplotlib.
I'm re-uploading the files that contain the different plots that I learned throughout the journey.

Libraries used:
- numpy
- matplotlib
